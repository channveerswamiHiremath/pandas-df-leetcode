### Real-World Impact
Learning Pandas is not just about coding challenges — it directly applies to real-world use cases:  
- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**  – Handle missing values, filter rows, and reshape data before analysis.  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  – Summarize, group, and visualize data to uncover insights.  
- **AI / Machine Learning / Deep Learning**  – Pandas is used to:  
     Prepare datasets before feeding into ML models (Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch).  
     Transform raw data into structured features.  
     Join, merge, and aggregate data for training and evaluation.  
- **Business & Industry Applications**  – Data-driven decision-making in finance, healthcare, e-commerce, etc.  

In short: **Pandas is the first step in any AI/ML pipeline.** Without clean, structured data, even the best neural networks won’t work effectively.
